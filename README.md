Various Java projects I completed during my time at NEIU. <br>
<br>
**AbstractExtended:** <br>
This Java project implements an employee management system using inheritance and file handling. It defines an abstract Employee class with subclasses for Faculty and StudentWorker. The system calculates and stores paycheck information, and uses a FileOperator class to write employee data to a file. Additionally, it includes unit tests to verify object creation, paycheck calculations, and file writing functionality.

**BinarySearch:** <br>
This Java-based Binary Search Tree implementation includes key operations such as adding elements, performing in-order traversal, finding the maximum element, and evaluating mathematical expression trees. The BST class handles the tree's core logic, using non-recursive methods for insertion and traversal. The BSTNode class defines individual nodes with left and right children. Additionally, there are various tests to validate the functionality of the tree, including correctness of traversal, tree size, maximum element, and evaluation of binary expression trees.
