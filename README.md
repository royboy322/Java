Various Java projects I completed during my time at NEIU.
This Java project implements an employee management system using inheritance and file handling. It defines an abstract Employee class with subclasses for Faculty and StudentWorker. The system calculates and stores paycheck information, and uses a FileOperator class to write employee data to a file. Additionally, it includes unit tests to verify object creation, paycheck calculations, and file writing functionality.
